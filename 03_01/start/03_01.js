//An Object it's like a file folder with labels. An Object is comprised of a series of names and values that are all grouped together. Syntactically, here's what they look like, I'm going to assign this to another variable. So, we'll call this a not empty Object. So, so far this Object is empty because there's nothing within these curly braces, we need to add some stuff.

var notEmptyObject = {
    'label' : 'value', 'label2' : 'value2'
};



notEmptyObject
{label: "value", label2: "value2"}
label
:
"value"
label2
:
"value2"
__proto__
:
Object
